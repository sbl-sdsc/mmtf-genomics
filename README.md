# mmtf-proteomics
Methods for mapping genomics data onto 3D protein structure.

A few example Jupyter Notebooks are available for testing and feedback.

* [S_sulphenylationTo3DStructure.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/blob/master/mmtf_proteomics/analysis/S_sulphenylationTo3DStructure.ipynb): Map S-sulphenylation data to 3D structure
* [QueryDbPTM.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/blob/master/mmtf_proteomics/analysis/QueryDbPTM.ipynb): Query the dbPTM database by UniProt Id, UniProt Name, or PDB/Chain Id  and map PTMs to 3D structure
* [BrowseDbPTM.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/blob/master/mmtf_proteomics/analysis/BrowseDbPTM.ipynb): Browse dbPTM database by PTM type and map to 3D structure

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/master) to run life Jupter Notebooks in your web browser without software installation.

Launching the Binder server may take a few minutes. [Binder (beta)](https://mybinder.org/) is an experimental platform for reproducible research (The Binder servers can be slow, may run out of memory, or may not always work).

Then navigate to the mmtf_proteomics/analysis directory and launch any of the notebooks.

Please send [feedback or feature requests](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-proteomics/issues).

Interested in a collaboration? Please send us interesting proteomics or PTM datasets to map onto 3D structure.
